It sounds like you're making great progress with your **AI-Based Crop Recommendation System (TGPDS20)**! However, I don't have direct access to external links like Google Colab. But I can still assist you with the next steps or guide you on how to work with your model on Google Colab.

### Adding Progress Update to Your Project

Here's how you can update your **progress** in the project:

---

### **Progress Update**
- **Data Fetching**: The dataset has been successfully fetched from authorized sources, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
- **Model Training**: The model is currently being trained. It may take approximately 20 minutes to complete the training process. Once trained, it will provide crop recommendations based on soil, climate, and weather conditions.

You can track the progress of model training by checking the logs or output in your Colab notebook, and once the training is complete, you will be able to evaluate the model and start integrating it into your application.

### If you want assistance with Google Colab:
- **Loading Dataset**: Ensure that your dataset is properly loaded into the Colab environment.
- **Model Training**: Check the status of your model training using `model.fit()` (or equivalent) and ensure you're using the right parameters for faster training.
- **Saving Progress**: You can save your trained model using:
  ```python
  model.save('crop_recommendation_model.h5')  # For Keras models
  ```
- **Model Evaluation**: Once the model is trained, you can evaluate it using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error (MSE), depending on your model's objective.

Certainly! Here's how you can add the **Tech Stack** section to your project documentation:

### **Tech Stack**
The **AI-Based Crop Recommendation System (TGPDS20)** utilizes a robust set of technologies to ensure smooth development and deployment. Below is the list of technologies used:

1. **Frontend:**
   - **HTML**: For structuring the web pages and creating the user interface.
   - **CSS**: For styling the web pages and providing an attractive user interface.
   - **JavaScript**: For interactivity and dynamic content on the frontend.
   - **Jinja**: A templating engine for rendering dynamic content in the Flask-based backend.

2. **Backend:**
   - **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework used to build the web application and provide an API for the AI model.
   - **Python (Colab)**: Google Colab is used to run and train the machine learning model. It provides an interactive environment for developing and experimenting with the AI model.

3. **Machine Learning:**
   - **Google Colab**: Used for training the machine learning model on datasets and performing the computations in a cloud-based environment.
   - **VS Code**: Used as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing the frontend and backend components of the application.
